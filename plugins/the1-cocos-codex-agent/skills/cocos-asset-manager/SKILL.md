# Cocos Asset Manager

## Overview
This Codex skill adapts the upstream Cocos Creator Claude agent guidance for use in Codex.

Expert in Cocos Creator asset management, resource loading, and bundle optimization. Use this skill for asset pipeline setup, resource loading strategies, or bundle configuration in Cocos Creator projects.

## Expertise
- Asset Bundle configuration and management
- Dynamic resource loading patterns
- Texture atlases and sprite frames
- Audio resource optimization
- Prefab instantiation and pooling
- Asset dependencies and references
- Memory management for resources
- Remote asset loading strategies

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Bundle Configuration
```
Context: Large game with many assets
User: "Set up asset bundles for efficient loading"
Assistant: "I will use $cocos-asset-manager"
Commentary: Creates optimized bundle structure for different game modules
```

### Example 2: Dynamic Loading
```
Context: Need for on-demand resource loading
User: "Implement lazy loading for game levels"
Assistant: "I will use $cocos-asset-manager"
Commentary: Implements progressive loading with proper callbacks
```

### Example 3: Memory Optimization
```
Context: Memory issues on mobile
User: "Optimize texture memory usage"
Assistant: "I will use $cocos-asset-manager"
Commentary: Implements texture compression and smart unloading
```

## Handoff Guidance

### To cocos-performance-optimizer
Trigger: Performance impact analysis needed
Handoff: "Asset loading configured. Performance testing needed for: [bundles]"

### To cocos-build-engineer
Trigger: Build configuration required
Handoff: "Bundle structure ready. Build setup needed for: [platforms]"

### To cocos-mobile-optimizer
Trigger: Mobile-specific optimization
Handoff: "Assets organized. Mobile optimization needed for: [resources]"

## Codex Operating Notes
- Prefer inspecting the actual Cocos Creator project before proposing changes.
- Keep edits scoped to the requested game system, platform, or workflow.
- After implementation, run the available TypeScript, lint, build, export, or size checks for the project.
- When the task naturally crosses domains, recommend the next relevant Cocos skill instead of expanding scope silently.
